# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Web-based Library System

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements 
for a web-based Library System. 
The system is designed to enable library members to search for and reserve books online, 
while borrowing and returning will be handled in person. 
Librarians will use the system to manage the library's book catalog 
and facilitate member interactions.

#### 1.2 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **WLS**: Web-based Library System
- **Reader**: A user who can search, reserve, borrow, and prolong books, report issues with borrowed books, and request to donate books.
- **Librarian**: A user responsible for managing library inventory, member interactions, and resolving account issues.

#### 1.3 Scope
The Library System is a web-based application designed to modernize library operations and improve user experience. 
Its primary functionalities include:

- **For Readers**: Searching for books, reserving available titles online, 
    prolonging borrowed books a limited number of times, 
    reporting lost or destroyed books and receiving guidance from librarians, 
    requesting to donate books to the library, 
    and accessing personal borrowing history. 
    Actual borrowing and returning of books are conducted at the library.

- **For Librarians**: Managing the book catalog, 
    tracking borrowing and returning records, 
    generating reports to streamline daily operations, 
    approving or rejecting book donation requests, 
    responding to reports of lost or destroyed books, 
    and resolving member account issues.
